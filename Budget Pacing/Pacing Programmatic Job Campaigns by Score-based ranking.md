## Goal
Maximize total number of clicks while also giving lower budget advertisements the opportunity
to get exposed

## Metrics
not specified => limitation

## Data
Instead of using real dataset, this paper made several assumptions, and simulated data.

## Interesting points
1. This paper used two trade-off functions in one equation to ensure that
   the low-interested jobs (=low budget advertisements) also have enough exposure to candidates (users) at the same time
2. One equation contained every information, which was intuitive and easy to understand.

## Limitations
1. Since this paper simulated data under basic assumptions, whereas real-world data is very complex.
2. Since this paper set a model and simulated, it is neither optimization problem nor A/B test.
